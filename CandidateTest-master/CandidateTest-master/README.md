# Candidate Coding Test

## Guidelines
### Please do not fork this repository
Please clone this repository and push it to your own publically available repository (e.g. Github, Bitbucket) and once you have completed the Task please send a link to it back to your recruitment contact for reviewing.

_You can install [Visual Studio Community](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-community-vs.aspx) & [Resharper Trial](https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/download/) if you do not have copies on your computer._


## Scenario
The application you will be building is a questionnaire. There is a Web API Service in the solution which will provide you with the questions. The solution uses a hardcoded/mocked repository to avoid using a real data source.

It is expected that you will produce:
* Tested maintainable code
* Clean code and OOP design

You are free to make any changes you feel necessary but it would be good to keep consistency in mind.

## Tasks
1. Using the MVC app in the solution consume the REST Web API service. Display the Questions on a web page along with UI elements for the answers.


**If you progress to the next stage you will be given more tasks to continue using your existing solution.**
